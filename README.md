# Repository Navigation
Our Github Repository contains 2 main folders names Data and Notebooks. The Notebooks folder has 3 jupyter notebooks in it. The first of those notebooks is titled Data_Cleaning and contains all of our data cleaning and exploration steps. It is important to run this notebook first as cleaned data csv files are created which the Modeling notebook then calls. The next notebook is titled Modeling and contains all of the models we created as well as evaluation for each model as well. xThe Data folder contains all of the raw data we looked at as well as the cleaned data we ended using reconverted back into csv files.
